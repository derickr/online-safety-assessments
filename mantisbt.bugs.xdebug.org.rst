Step 2: U2U and Search: Assess the risk of harm
===============================================

Additional characteristics and existing controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some definitions:

Absence of Harmful Content
	Since our start of operations in 2003, there has not been a single piece
	of content posted that could constitute of any harmful content.

Active Moderation
    All posts and comments are also send by email to the operator of the
	service, who is	indicated above. Any problematic content is therefore
	noticed fairly soon. The moderator has never had to remove content.

Little Content and Few Users
	The system has currently around 2760 users, of which 19 have been active
	in the preceding 30 days. In these same 30 days, only 11 new pieces of
	primary content have been posted.

No Child Users
	We have no evidence of children posting or visiting our service in any
	significant numbers.
