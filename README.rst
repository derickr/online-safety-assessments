This repository contains a set of risk assessments that I have created for
various services. These are released under CC-BY, and can be used as starting
point for your own assessments.

Although not required, it would be appreciated if you could create a pull
request to your version if you use any of these for inspiration, to share and
improve our collective assessments that are necessary under the UK's Online
Safety Act.
