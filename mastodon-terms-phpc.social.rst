Online Safety Act Specific Terms and Conditions
===============================================

*To implement "ICU G1 Terms of service: substance (all services)" we have
added the following section into our "about page"
(https://phpc.social/about).*

Handling Illegal Content
------------------------

The moderation team treats illegal content with the utmost gravity. When made
aware of the presence of illegal content, through Mastodon's reporting
features, or third party app reporting features, or through our contact email
address, hello@phpcommunity.org, we will take this down at the earliest
opportunity.

The phpc.social Mastodon instance does not use *proactive technology* to
detect illegal content.

We include specific provisions for the following types of content.

Terrorism Content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The type of content defined under `Online Safety Act 2023, Schedule
5 <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/schedule/5/enacted>`_ will be
taken down immediately, and will result in immediate and permanent revocation
of access to the service. Where possible, the offending account will also be
reported to law enforcement.

CSEA Content
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The type of content defined under `Online Safety Act 2023, Schedule
6 <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/schedule/6/enacted>`_ will be
taken down immediately, and will result in immediate and permanent revocation
of access to the service. Where possible, the offending account will also be
reported to law enforcement.

Priority Illegal Content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The type of content defined under `Online Safety Act 2023, Schedule
7 <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/schedule/7/enacted>`_ will be
taken down immediately, and will result in immediate and permanent revocation
of access to the service. Where possible, the offending account will also be
reported to law enforcement.

Complaints and Appeals
----------------------

Complaints about content are best reported through Mastodon's reporting
features, be that on the web site or through third party applications. This
creates an audit trail.

To appeal moderation actions you may contact us at hello@phpcommunity.org.

The decision made by the moderators is final. It is a privilege to use this
service, and not a right.
